# Weather App
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to search for and display the current weather information of a specific city. The app retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updates the user interface with the relevant information.

## Features
Search Bar: Users can enter the name of a city in the search bar to fetch the weather data for that location.

Weather Display: Once the user performs a search, the app fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the following information:

City name

Weather icon representing the current weather conditions

Weather description

Temperature in Celsius

Humidity percentage

Wind speed in kilometers per hour

Background Image: The app provides a visually appealing background image to enhance the user experience.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Enter the name of a city in the search bar.

Click the "Search" button or press Enter.

The app will fetch the weather data for the specified city and display it in the card.

The weather information will include the city name, weather icon, weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Technologies Used
The Weather App is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the web page.

CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the app's elements and layout.

JavaScript: Programming language used for fetching weather data from the API, manipulating the DOM, and handling user interactions.

OpenWeatherMap API: External API used to retrieve weather data for a specific city.

## Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.

style.css: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout for the app.

script.js: The JavaScript file that handles fetching weather data, updating the UI, and managing user interactions.

images/: Directory containing the background image used in the app.

## Future Improvements
The Weather App can be enhanced with the following features:

Extended Forecast: Provide a forecast for multiple days instead of just the current weather.

Geolocation: Implement geolocation to automatically fetch and display weather information for the user's current location.

Unit Conversion: Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units.

Error Handling: Display meaningful error messages when there are issues with fetching weather data or handling user inputs.

Additional Weather Details: Include more detailed weather information, such as sunrise and sunset times, visibility, and atmospheric pressure.
